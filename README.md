This was my first test environment that I used to make games. This game was made based on [this book](https://www.amazon.com.br/Desenvolva-jogos-HTML5-Canvas-JavaScript-ebook/dp/B01B6MBNE2/ref=asc_df_B01B6MBNE2/) that I got from the school library.

## The game

The game works like an arcade, the player controls a human spaceship that have to destroy all UFOs and protect the planet Earth. To play just use the arrow keys to control the ship and spacebar to shot.

## About the project
I made this game using the book instructions, and learned a lot about programming with javascript, using HTML canvas, making pixel arts, sound effects and spritesheets.

I got the sounds from a public database and without DMCA. The sprites were made by myself, except for the planets in the paralax.

### Project finished and closed
The game have simple features, but I've made it when I knew almost nothing about javascript and game design and the knowledge acquired was a lot important for all my next projects, like Gravitational, my first game that I produced by myself.
